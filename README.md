# ChordRingUsingGo
DOS Chord Project Golang

Designed and developed a distributed peer-to-peer system that implements the CHORD protocol with GO. A client initiates a connection with any ring node and performs operations such as lookup, insert, insertOrUpdate, delete, listKeys, listIDs and shutdown by using JSON-RPC messages. Ring nodes join and leave the system in a scheduled manner at any time while the remaining ring nodes continue to respond to client requests. 
Ring nodes manage a collection of triplets (key, relationship, value) called DICT3, where key and relation are valid JSON strings and value is a valid JSON object. The (key, relationship) pair identifies the triplet and is used to store the triplet into the appropriate node. Server responds to all properly¬ structured JSON¬-RPC messages for above operations. A client/ring node performs a lookup operation even by partially specifying a triplet’s identifier i.e. it performs lookup even if only key or only relation is provided. 
A client node can purge “RW” dictionary triplets that have not been accessed since some user specified time. Client reads a JSON-¬RPC request message from the standard input and makes the appropriate request to the server, and shows the response (if any). Both the client and server code takes as their 1st command line argument the filename that contains the client/server configuration JSON object, file name is config.json.
